        <h1>TALENTS</h1>
        <P>Talents are supernatural skills from God that help us to navigate ourself so as to identify our truest being.
            Most people excell in life when they master the skill of being good in what they love.Its not a surprise to say a bigger percent of the worlds population today dont identify with their talents maybe they are yet to discover but its not a wonder to find people testifying they got no talent at all which is all an illusion and a lie cause God is just ,,How could he forget to put a talent in you and you are just like him.
            I also thought i had no talent but its a matter of time before you start to feel it.
            To be honest you cant just find your talent..purpose to navigate what you think is your talent and then choose that impacts you directly cause thats your real talent.</P>
            <h2>ART</h2>
            <P> Art is the greatest of all talents.This is because of the great impact it has to peoples life.
                Musical artist and visual artists play a major role in mental health of the society.Our service to people is out of love for our talent and what is done out of love shall be great definetely thats why most people live for music .
                What am saying is ,as far us we have found our purpose as artist ..
                mastering our talent and developing it to its full potential then we can recreate purpose and meaning in others life.
                There is no better feeling than the feeling of being alive thats why i love and appreciate my skill cause there is an art piece i could do and change the mindset of millions of people cause what we see and hear has the ability to transform  our lifes.</P>

                <h3>Pencil Art</h3>
                <p>The most  sensational piece of art.This is because of its indegeneous nature.
                    Probably the most ancient as it deals with the most basic colours that is black nad white.It also identifies as the origin of the greatest Artists in the universe.
                    It has all the connections one has just to decide what is good to adventure and explore.</p>
                    <h2>painting</h2>
<p>
                        The most diverse and captivating.Dealing  with rainbow colours,,infact more...its really crazy or is it wisdom.Doing a sunset piece was really cool and the accoplishment magnificent.
                        Is it because i was using brushes and not pencil or it was the new feeling of exploring colours?I think its both cause they all dealing with new stuff and experiences are basically new stuff tried with all energy.                    </p>
                        <h1>SPORTING</h1>
                        <P>The realest stuff to get yourself doing.you really have to love a sport so that it is possible for you to invest in it.It takes alot of commitment and discpline for one to be actually good at something.
                            Discovering my love for scating was the greatest comeback i have ever made in my life.Everything felt right.</P>
