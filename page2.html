                    <h2>Fantasy meditation</h2>
                    <p>To start with ,,,everyone has ever fantasized.
                        This is because as humans we have wishful thopughts,
                         which can only be brought close to reality throught fantasy.when i was in highschool i loved my highschool English teacher as his lessons provided the opportunity to explore my world in my head.
                         Fantasies can help you find joy when stipulated in a location where angry/serious faces are needed.
                        Most working people dont enjoy their jobs,,,i dont know how many office days pass when they have not smiled.Does this mean that having a good paying job will not bring the joy and happiness which i thought will come with money?
                        As i said there is only one way to find out.Where is the real happinnes?</p>
                        <h2>Visionary Meditation</h2>
                        <p>This is simply fantasizing about dreams and goals that you have started to achieve,,
                            maybe you have just started or you are half way there.Here is where you start to unlock the endless possibilities.
                            This is because you will come to notice there are many ways to kill a rat as you try to find ways to reach your dreams.
                            It will make your mind big and creative and when its already that moment when you discover you are not just an ordinary being but a creatibe person,,
                            you start to work and run under different principles and rules that you discover yourself.I personally i work under my rules which i break more often but i adhere to on several instances.One major rule i always check is Time.I here them say time is a gem...
                            its  precious.When you start to value your time you start to identify your worth .This will help you not to waste time with unnecessary distractions . </p>

                            <h2>Quantum Healing</h2>
                            <p>The atmosphere is full of potential energy.From light energy ,the air itself is full of potential possibilities.Here is the thing...Deep focus and putting all the attention with all your energy into something you actually find control over it.
                                You can manipulate untill you achieve the desired results.
                                Quantum healing is there achieved through change of your thoughts and how you percieve life.
                                Having positive mindset and purposing to put your energy where you think is the right place will help you find healing you thought was never there.
                                Most people actually pass because of the trauma from stigmization by heartless people.Its is good to always mind your language while handling a critical problem as words impact and it is unevedable.Make it fit to always have a positive impact to people ,,encourage them to persevere for we are not in this world alone.
                                We are here for others and some are here for us.</p>
